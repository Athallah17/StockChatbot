    q: "Is this a real financial advisor?",
    a: "No, this is an AI-powered tool that gives recommendations based on data, not personalized financial advice."
  },
  {
    q: "What data sources does it use?",
    a: "We pull data from Yahoo Finance, NewsAPI, and sentiment analysis models."
  },
  {
    q: "How often is the data updated?",
    a: "Stock data and news are updated in real-time, based on market API responses."

  },
  {
    q: "Is my data stored or tracked?",
    a: "No user data is permanently stored or tracked. All queries are stateless."
  },
  {
    q: "Can this chatbot replace a financial advisor?",
